### Installing Commitizen
Install Commitizen through npm.
```
npm install -g commitizen
```

### Using Commitizen
To commit using Commitizen, you must run `git cz` instead of `git commit`. When working in a Commitizen Friendly repository, `git cz` will help you draft formatted commit messages; however, while working in a repository that does not use Commitizen, git cz behaves like git commit.

## Adding a Feature
